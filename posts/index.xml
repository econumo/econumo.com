Think of it as the starting line. Hitting that 20% mark helps you get into the rhythm of paying yourself first, which is crucial for tackling debt, building an emergency fund, and investing for the long haul.</description></item><item><title>A Simple Guide to Income and Expenses</title><link>https://econumo.com/posts/income-and-expenses/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 06:46:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://econumo.com/posts/income-and-expenses/</guid><description>Getting a handle on your money really just comes down to one thing: the relationship between your income and expenses.
