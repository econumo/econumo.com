It will provide you with the basic information about the application and explain the main concepts and motivation behind it.\nEconumo\u0026rsquo;s concept # The purpose of Econumo is to help you manage your money more effectively, whether on your own or together with your partner, using the data you provide.\nHow it started # I started using expense trackers in 2008 and have experimented with many since then. You might wonder why I switched apps. Here are a few reasons that may resonate with you:\nI switched between iPhone and Android. I traveled to other countries and needed a tool to track expenses in different currencies. I eventually realized I needed a budgeting tool, not just an expense tracker. After getting married, I needed a family budgeting and planning tool that supported multiple platforms. The last app I used had a bug in the sync/backup process, resulting in the loss of all my data with no recovery option. In September 2020, after this data loss, I researched but couldn’t find an app that met my family\u0026rsquo;s needs. So, I decided to create one more budgeting app: Econumo (eh-koh-NOO-mo). Since then, my spouse and I have used it regularly, and I continuously improve it to help us manage our money better.\nI decided to publish Econumo in December 2024 to benefit others and give back to the community for the self-hosted tools I personally use. Therefore, you can use Econumo CE completely free as a self-hosted option (see Editions to learn more).\nContents # The guide consists of the following sections:\nGetting Started Editions User Guide Self-Hosting Contact Us FAQ "},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/self-hosting/cli-commands/","title":"CLI (terminal) commands","section":"Self-Hosting","content":" CLI (terminal) commands # Econumo provides several CLI commands that are useful for managing the application.\nList of available commands # Application specific: # docker-compose exec -u www-data econumo bin/console | grep app: All available commands: # docker-compose exec -u www-data econumo bin/console CLI commands # Create a user # docker-compose exec -u www-data econumo bin/console app:create-user --help Change user e-mail # docker-compose exec -u www-data econumo bin/console app:change-user-email --help Change user password # docker-compose exec -u www-data econumo bin/console app:change-user-password --help "},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/user-guide/accounts/","title":"Accounts","section":"User Guide","content":" Accounts # This section covers basics of \u0026lsquo;Accounts\u0026rsquo; in Econumo.\nAccounts represents your accounts in financial institutions.

This way, you set limits on your spending for each category.\nEconumo allows you to create virtual envelopes and allocate your funds accordingly, so you can easily track how much money remains for each specific category.\nIn this section # Budget creation Update budget details Manage your budget Budgeting Organizing your budget Managing budget folders Managing budget elements Work with the budget Folder statistics Envelope, category, and tag spending Changing currency for budget elements Budgets list Shared access Budget creation # You can create a budget in two places:\nFrom the Budget page in the left sidebar.

Categories - Your Econumo categories. Tags - Your Econumo tags. These aggregate your spending (e.g., you might plan to fly to Europe on vacation). Envelopes - These allow you to group categories (e.g., an envelope for Food could contain categories like Groceries, Drinks, and Restaurants). Budgeting # The goal of budgeting is to maintain your monthly budget. Ideally, you should prepare your budget before the month starts and make minor adjustments during the month as needed. The budget will indicate how much money remains in your virtual envelopes.\nYour budget consists of four columns:\nCategory/Tag/Envelope Name Budgeted Amount - The amount of money you plan to spend or save. Spending Amount - The amount you have actually spent. Available Amount - The total available, which includes funds transferred from previous months combined with the budgeted amount. You can adjust the numbers in the budgeted amount, as shown in the picture below:\nOrganizing your budget # The default structure of your budget may not be optimal. To change it, click on Configure in the top right corner and select Edit Structure.\nYou can create new folders, reorder items, and move elements between folders. All changes apply instantly.
