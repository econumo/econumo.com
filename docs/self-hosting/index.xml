In general, tweaking is not recommended; please do so at your own risk. If you are familiar with PHP and Symfony, you can add functionality to the backend, such as:
Custom CLI commands; New APIs; Additional handlers for domain events. However, keep in mind that your code may break at some point due to changes in the Econumo codebase.
How to do that # Econumo uses a modified Symfony Kernel to load all Bundles from src folder.</description></item><item><title>Tweaking the frontend</title><link>https://econumo.com/docs/self-hosting/tweaking-frontend/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://econumo.com/docs/self-hosting/tweaking-frontend/</guid><description>Tweaking the frontend # WARNING! In general, tweaking is not recommended; please do so at your own risk. Econumo uses the JavaScript tag manager LilTag, allowing you to inject any JavaScript code into your Econumo instance.
I use this mechanism to show a warning message on demo.econumo.com and to inject analytics scripts.
In this guide, we&amp;rsquo;ll inject the following script into your Econumo:
&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;console.log(&amp;#39;Injected!&amp;#39;);&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; Configuration # Step 1 # Add the following environment variables to your .</description></item><item><title>CLI (terminal) commands</title><link>https://econumo.com/docs/self-hosting/cli-commands/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://econumo.com/docs/self-hosting/cli-commands/</guid><description> CLI (terminal) commands # Econumo provides several CLI commands that are useful for managing the application.

Econumo CE stores its data in SQLite, so it is easy to configure a regularly back up of your database. Consider the following well-known options in the SQLite community for effective backup management.
Regular Cron-based backups # For personal use, a regular cron-based backup may be sufficient. You can find a straightforward guide on setting this up here: https://litestream.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Currency support</title><link>https://econumo.com/docs/self-hosting/multi-currency/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://econumo.com/docs/self-hosting/multi-currency/</guid><description>Multi-Currency Support # Econumo offers multi-currency functionality. To get started, you need to:
Load currencies into your Econumo instance. Set up a daily update for currency rates. To simplify this process, we have developed a tool that updates currencies and exchange rates using data from https://openexchangerates.org.
You can find the tool and its documentation here: https://github.com/econumo/currency-loader
Base currency is not your default currency. It is only used for conversions.</description></item></channel></rss>
