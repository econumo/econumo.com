To get started, you need to:
Load currencies into your Econumo instance. Set up a daily update for currency rates. To simplify this process, we have developed a tool that updates currencies and exchange rates using data from https://openexchangerates.org.
You can find the tool here: https://github.com/econumo/currency-loader
Installation # Register at https://openexchangerates.org and generate your API keys. Clone the repository or download the binary file from the releases page.</description></item></channel></rss>
