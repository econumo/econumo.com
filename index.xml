A vague idea of a &amp;ldquo;nice house in a good neighborhood&amp;rdquo; won&amp;rsquo;t cut it. To build a savings plan that actually works, you need a crystal-clear vision you can slap a price tag on.

The classic rule of thumb is to aim for 20% of your take-home pay. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just a random number; it&amp;rsquo;s the savings portion of the popular 50/30/20 budget, a simple framework that can really build a strong financial foundation.
Think of it as the starting line. Hitting that 20% mark helps you get into the rhythm of paying yourself first, which is crucial for tackling debt, building an emergency fund, and investing for the long haul.</description></item><item><title>A Simple Guide to Income and Expenses</title><link>https://econumo.com/posts/income-and-expenses/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 06:46:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://econumo.com/posts/income-and-expenses/</guid><description>Getting a handle on your money really just comes down to one thing: the relationship between your income and expenses. It’s a simple idea. Income is what comes in, and expenses are what goes out. The whole game of financial wellness is just making sure more money is coming in than going out, consistently.

The concept is straightforward: Take a few envelopes, label each with an expense category—such as groceries, rent, or car loan—and place the amount of money you plan to spend in each envelope. This way, you set limits on your spending for each category.</description></item><item><title>Classifications</title><link>https://econumo.com/docs/user-guide/classifications/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://econumo.com/docs/user-guide/classifications/</guid><description>Classifications # This section introduces the basics of &amp;lsquo;Classifications&amp;rsquo; in Econumo, including Categories, Tags, and Payees.
