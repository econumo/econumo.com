These little charges aren&amp;rsquo;t just a minor annoyance. They&amp;rsquo;re a real drain on your funds, especially on longer trips.

The easiest way to think about it is to compare it to a home mortgage. When you get a mortgage, the house itself acts as collateral. If you can&amp;rsquo;t make the payments, the bank has a claim on your house. A secured bond works on the same principle for investors.
A company or government entity that issues a secured bond pledges a specific, valuable asset—think a factory, a fleet of aircraft, or a portfolio of real estate—as a safety net for the investor.</description></item><item><title>v0.9.0 Econumo release</title><link>https://econumo.com/posts/v0.9.0-release/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://econumo.com/posts/v0.9.0-release/</guid><description>The v0.9.0 release introduces a fully open-source version of Econumo under a single repository, licensed under the MIT license.

Budgets enable you to implement a &amp;ldquo;Cash Stuffing&amp;rdquo; method, also known as the envelope budgeting approach, which uses envelopes to manage spending.
The concept is straightforward: Take a few envelopes, label each with an expense category—such as groceries, rent, or car loan—and place the amount of money you plan to spend in each envelope. This way, you set limits on your spending for each category.</description></item><item><title>Classifications</title><link>https://econumo.com/docs/user-guide/classifications/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://econumo.com/docs/user-guide/classifications/</guid><description>Classifications # This section introduces the basics of &amp;lsquo;Classifications&amp;rsquo; in Econumo, including Categories, Tags, and Payees.
