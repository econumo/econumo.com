It will provide you with the basic information about the application and explain the main concepts and motivation behind it.\nEconumo\u0026rsquo;s concept # I started using money tracker applications in 2008. I have tried many applications, and used some of them for a long time. You may wonder why I changed them? There were few reasons, which might apply to you as well:\nI switched from Iphone to Android. I travelled to other countries and needed a tool to track expenses in different currencies. At some point I realized that I need a budgeting tool, not just a money tracker. I married and needed a tool for the family budgeting and planning which supports different platforms. The last app we used had a bug in the sync/backup process, and we lost all the data without the ability to recover it. In September 2020, after the data loss, I decided to create my own money tracker, which will:\nHave a simple and intuitive interface. Be available on all platforms. Support multiple currencies. Support multiple users. Have a budgeting tool. Be open-source and can be self-hosted. This is how Econumo started. I hope you will find it useful for your needs as well.\nContents # The guide consists of the following sections:\nGetting Started Editions Open Source FAQ "},{"id":1,"href":"/posts/v0.1.0-release/","title":"v0.1.0 Econumo Release","section":"Blog","content":"The first public release of Econumo.\nEconumo One: v0.1.0 Econumo Family: v0.1.0 "},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/edition/","title":"Econumo Editions","section":"Getting Started","content":" Econumo Editions # Econumo provides versatile editions to meet various needs:\nEconumo CLOUD # Suited for individuals and families seeking convenience and access, this cloud-hosted solution offers a comprehensive suite of financial management tools available anytime, anywhere.\nEconumo FAMILY # Designed for households needing a self-hosted, collaborative approach, this platform supports up to 10 users, ensuring everyone stays aligned financially.\nEconumo ONE # Tailored for solo users who prefer a self-hosted solution, this free platform delivers powerful financial management features for those who prioritize privacy and control over their budgeting.\nTo get started with Econumo One, please follow the instructions on the GitHub repository.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/open-source/multi-currency/","title":"Multi-Currency support","section":"Open Source","content":" Multi-Currency Support # Econumo offers multi-currency functionality.
