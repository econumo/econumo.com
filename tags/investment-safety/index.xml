The easiest way to think about it is to compare it to a home mortgage. When you get a mortgage, the house itself acts as collateral. If you can&amp;rsquo;t make the payments, the bank has a claim on your house. A secured bond works on the same principle for investors.
A company or government entity that issues a secured bond pledges a specific, valuable asset—think a factory, a fleet of aircraft, or a portfolio of real estate—as a safety net for the investor.</description></item></channel></rss>
