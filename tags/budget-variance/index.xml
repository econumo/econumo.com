Think of it like planning a road trip. Your budget is the map—the route you&amp;rsquo;ve planned, the estimated gas money, the hotels you&amp;rsquo;ve picked out. Your actuals are the journey itself, complete with the unexpected detour, the surprise tourist trap, and the amazing roadside diner you hadn&amp;rsquo;t planned for.</description></item></channel></rss>
