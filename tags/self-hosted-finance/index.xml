Put simply, it’s a type of financial tool where the source code—the very blueprint of the software—is open for anyone to see, use, and even improve upon.
Think of it like a community cookbook for managing your money. It&amp;rsquo;s completely transparent, you can tailor the recipes to your taste, and it isn&amp;rsquo;t controlled by a single corporate entity. This approach puts you in the driver&amp;rsquo;s seat, giving you total ownership of your financial data.</description></item></channel></rss>
