It will provide you with the basic information about the application and explain the main concepts and motivation behind it.\nEconumo\u0026rsquo;s concept # I started using money tracker applications in 2008. I have tried many applications, and used some of them for a long time. You may wonder why I changed them? There were few reasons, which might apply to you as well:\nI switched from Iphone to Android. I travelled to other countries and needed a tool to track expenses in different currencies. At some point I realized that I need a budgeting tool, not just a money tracker. I married and needed a tool for the family budgeting and planning which supports different platforms. The last app we used had a bug in the sync/backup process, and we lost all the data without the ability to recover it. In September 2020, after the data loss, I decided to create my own money tracker, which will:\nHave a simple and intuitive interface. Be available on all platforms. Support multiple currencies. Support multiple users. Have a budgeting tool. Be open-source and can be self-hosted. This is how Econumo started. I hope you will find it useful for your needs as well.\nContents # The guide consists of the following sections:\nGetting Started Editions Open Source FAQ "},{"id":1,"href":"/posts/v0.4.1-release/","title":"v0.4.1 Econumo release","section":"Blog","content":" Changelog # Updated email content.
